- Generate hypothetical scenarios related to the topic
- Ask about past experiences, future goals, and different perspectives
- Keep the candidate talking throughout the ENTIRE {{mins}} minute duration
- Casual responses like "thanks", "that's it", or "goodbye" should NOT trigger call end before time is up
